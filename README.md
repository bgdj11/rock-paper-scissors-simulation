# Rock Paper Scissors Simulation

This repository contains a Python script that simulates a Rock Paper Scissors game using Pygame.

## Description

The Python script creates a simple simulation of the Rock Paper Scissors game. It utilizes Pygame to create a graphical interface where rocks, papers, and scissors move around the screen. The simulation allows these objects to interact, changing their appearances based on collisions and movements.

## Motivation

This simulation was developed as an exploration into graphical simulations using Pygame, a popular library for creating 2D games and visualizations in Python. The project aimed to delve into the principles of object-oriented programming, collision detection, and interactive graphical interfaces.

By creating this Rock Paper Scissors simulation, I sought to gain practical experience in game development concepts while exploring the functionalities of Pygame. The project allowed me to experiment with object behaviors, user interactions, and visual representations within a simulated environment.
